                <p className="text-extending h3">4.2  How Does The Infrastructure Deals Network Ltd Protect
                    Customers'
                    Personal Data?</p>
                <p className="text-extending">We are concerned with keeping your data secure and protecting it from
                    inappropriate disclosure. Any
                    Personal Data collected by us is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special
                    access rights to such systems and are bound by obligations of confidentiality. If and when we use
                    subcontractors to store your data, we will not relinquish control of your Personal Data or expose it
                    to security risks that would not have arisen had the data remained in our possession. However,
                    unfortunately no transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It
                    may be possible for third parties not under the control of The Infrastructure Deals Network Ltd to
                    intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect
                    your Personal Data, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Data you transmit to
                    us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk. If you believe that your interaction with us is
                    no longer secure, please contact us.</p>
                <p className="text-extending h3">4.3  How to Request your Data and the Process for Obtaining it</p>
                <p className="text-extending">You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise
                    any of the other rights).
                    However, if your request is clearly unfounded, we could refuse to comply with your request.</p>
                <p className="text-extending">We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your
                    identity and ensure you
                    have the right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a
                    security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to
                    receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request
                    to speed up our response.</p>
                <h2 className="head3 P4-S3">5  YOUR DATA AND THIRD PARTIES</h2>
                <p className="text-extending h3">5.1  Will We Share Your Data With Third Parties?</p>
                <p className="text-extending">We may also share Personal Data with interested parties in the event that The
                    Infrastructure Deals
                    Network Ltd anticipates a change in control or the acquisition of all or part of our business or
                    assets or with interested parties in connection with the licensing of our technology.</p>
                <p className="text-extending">If The Infrastructure Deals Network Ltd is sold or makes a sale or transfer,
                    we may, in our sole
                    discretion, transfer, sell or assign your Personal Data to a third party as part of or in connection
                    with that transaction. Upon such transfer, the Privacy Policy of the acquiring entity may govern the
                    further use of your Personal Data. In all other situations your data will still remain protected in
                    accordance with this Privacy Policy (as amended from time to time).</p>
                <p className="text-extending">We may share your Personal Data at any time if required for legal reasons or
                    in order to enforce our
                    terms or this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <h2 className="head3 P4-S3">6  HOW LONG WILL WE RETAIN YOUR DATA FOR?</h2>
                <p className="text-extending">We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary to
                    fulfil the purposes we
                    collected it for. We may retain your Personal Data for a longer period than usual in the event of a
                    complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our
                    relationship with you.</p>
                <h2 className="head3 P4-S3">7  AGE LIMIT FOR OUR USERS</h2>
                <p className="text-extending">You must not use The Infrastructure Deals Network Ltd unless you are aged 21
                    or older. If you are
                    under 21 and you access The Infrastructure Deals Network Ltd by lying about your age, you must
                    immediately stop using The Infrastructure Deals Network Ltd.</p>
                <p className="text-extending">This website is not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect data
                    relating to
                    children.</p>
                <h2 className="head3 P4-S3">8  INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF DATA</h2>
                <p className="text-extending">Your information may be stored and processed in the US or other countries or
                    jurisdictions outside
                    the US where The Infrastructure Deals Network Ltd has facilities. We are currently storing data in
                    the EU and so, by using The Infrastructure Deals Network Ltd, you are permitting and consenting to
                    the transfer of information, including Personal Data, outside of the US.</p>
                <h2 className="head3 P4-S3">9  NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES AND ACCEPTANCE OF POLICY</h2>
                <p className="text-extending">We keep our Privacy Policy under review and will place any updates on this
                    webpage. This version is
                    dated 7 January 2021. By using The Infrastructure Deals Network Ltd, you consent to the collection
                    and use of data by us as set out in this Privacy Policy. Continued access or use of The
                    Infrastructure Deals Network Ltd will constitute your express acceptance of any modifications to
                    this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <h2 className="head3 P4-S3">10  INTERPRETATION</h2>
                <p className="text-extending">All uses of the word &quot;including&quot; mean &quot;including but not
                    limited to&quot; and the
                    enumerated examples are not intended to in any way limit the term which they serve to illustrate.
                    Any email addresses set out in this policy may be used solely for the purpose for which they are
                    stated to be provided, and any unrelated correspondence will be ignored. Unless otherwise required
                    by law, we reserve the right to not respond to emails, even if they relate to a legitimate subject
                    matter for which we have provided an email address. As a matter of common sense, you are more likely
                    to get a reply if your request or question is polite, reasonable and there is no relatively obvious
                    other way to deal with or answer your concern or question (e.g. FAQs, other areas of our website
                    etc.).</p>
                <p className="text-extending">Our staff are not authorised to contract on behalf of The Infrastructure Deals
                    Network Ltd, waive
                    rights or make representations (whether contractual or otherwise). If anything contained in an email
                    from a The Infrastructure Deals Network Ltd address contradicts anything in this policy, our terms
                    or any official public announcement on our website, or is inconsistent with or amounts to a waiver
                    of any The Infrastructure Deals Network Ltd rights, the email content will be read down to grant
                    precedence to the latter. The only exception to this is genuine correspondence expressed to be from
                    the The Infrastructure Deals Network Ltd legal department.</p>
