            <p>This agreement is entered into between a Firm and the Advisor automatically on every occasion on which
                the Advisor selects the Firm for an Opportunity. Each of the Firm and Advisor (each a “party”) agrees as
                follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span className="number--indent">1.</span> This agreement governs the terms and conditions under
                    which:

                    <ul>
                        <li><span className="letters--indent">(i)</span> an Advisor may disclose Confidential
                            Information to a Firm in connection with an
                            Opportunity;
                        </li>
                        <li><span className="letters--indent">(ii)</span> the Firm may disclose Confidential Information
                            to an Advisor as part of evaluating an
                            Opportunity and/or negotiating a Transaction; and
                        </li>
                        <li><span className="letters--indent">(iii)</span> in each case how Confidential Information is
                            treated.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span className="number--indent">2.</span> Capitalised terms not otherwise defined herein shall have
                    the meaning given in Schedule 1 to
                    the Terms. This agreement is intended to supplement and not replace any provisions of the Terms.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><span className="number--indent">3.</span> Except in accordance with paragraph 4 below, or otherwise
                    with the written consent of the
                    other party, neither the Firm nor the Advisor shall disclose Confidential Information to any person
                    other than its
                    Representatives and shall limit dissemination of Confidential Information to such Representatives
                    who
                    have a “need to know” and have been advised of the confidentiality provisions of this agreement.
                    Each of
                    the Firm and the Advisor shall be responsible for any breach of this agreement by its own
                    Representatives.
                </li>
                <li><span className="number--indent">4.</span> Each of the Firm and the Advisor may disclose
                    Confidential Information only if, after
                    consultation with counsel, it reasonably believes such disclosure must be made in order to comply
                    with applicable law,
                    regulation or legal or judicial process. If the Firm or the Advisor, or any of its Representatives,
                    becomes legally compelled (including by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena,
                    civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, the
                    Firm
                    or the Advisor (as applicable) shall, except as prohibited by law, provide the other party with
                    prompt
                    prior written notice of such requirement so that the other party may seek a protective order or
                    other
                    appropriate remedy. If such protective order is not obtained, the disclosing party agrees to
                    disclose
                    only that portion of the Confidential Information which, following consultation with counsel, it
                    reasonably believes is legally required to be disclosed and will take reasonable steps to preserve
                    the
                    confidentiality of the Confidential Information (including obtaining reasonable assurance that
                    confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information).
